	 * The GameServer has the following responsibilites:
	 * 1. Waits for clients to connect.
	 * 2. When a client connects, GS stores the clients name in one array, and socket in another.
	 * 3. When three clients are connected, the GS begins the game as follows:
	 * 		A. Creates a deck
	 * 		B. Creates the Players object
	 * 		C. Creates the Pool
	 * 4. Passes the Players and the Pool to the clients.
	 * 
	 * Then, the GS waits for messages from the clients. 
	 * When the GS receives a message, GS sends that message out to all clients.
	 * 
	 * GS also keeps track of permissions. 
	 * GS knows who the current player is. 
	 * GS sends TRUE to the current player, and FALSE to the other players.
